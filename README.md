# ToDoApp-JavaFullStack
I built a small web app where you can add and see tasks.  Java code handles logic (what happens when you add a task).  HTML shows pages in browser.  CSS and images make it look good.  Spring Boot is the engine running your app on your computer.  Controller is the middleman between your pages and Java code.
